## Quality control in MRI data
*Franz Liem (franziskus.liem@uzh.ch)*

We will discuss approaches to check quality of structural and functional MRI data (T1w, diffusion and functional data; raw data and derivatives like FreeSurfer reconstructions). We will also look into tools that help to visually check data quality and extract metrics of data quality.

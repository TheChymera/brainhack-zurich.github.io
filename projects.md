# List of Projects

## Quality control in MRI data
*Franz Liem (franziskus.liem@uzh.ch)*

We will discuss approaches to check quality of structural and functional MRI data (T1w, diffusion and functional data; raw data and derivatives like FreeSurfer reconstructions). We will also look into tools that help to visually check data quality and extract metrics of data quality.


    
## SAMRI
*Horea Christian (ioanas@biomed.ee.ethz.ch)*

High-level integrated pipelines for small animal magnetic resonance imaging. SAMRI automatically, transparently, and reproducibly takes you from raw scanner data to wonderful figures, and gives you access to numerous small-animal optimizations in data processing and analysis.


    
## Statistical methods for longitudinal data
*Jessica Oschwald (jessica.oschwald@uzh.ch)*

We will discuss and compare different statistical methods suited to analyze longitudinal data, with a focus on modeling change processes over time (e.g., multilevel models, latent change models). Specifically, we will talk about the most common issues encountered when fitting these type of models, with the aim of identifying best practices. How can we compute a measure of effect size? How do we decide on the best fitting model? What are tools that can help with fitting and visualizing model outputs?
